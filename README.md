# LogiAsm - Generic Logisim Assembler #

The goal of this project is to have a generic assembler available for assembling arbitrary instruction sets into 
machine code suitable for use in [Logisim][lg].  

## Current Work ##

Currently, work is being done to transform smasm.py into a more readable, and generic assembler, logiasm.py

## History ##

### SMIPS ###

SMIPS (Simple MIPS) was the instruction set for which LogiAsm was originally written, then called SMAsm.  This version 
is preserved under the legacy directory.
